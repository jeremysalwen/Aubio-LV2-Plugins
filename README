The package provides LV2 plugin wrappers for the following Aubio functions:

 * Transient/Steady State Separation
 * Onset Detection

This package requires Aubio to be installed in your system in order to compile.

To compile, run 

$./configure
$make

To install, run 

$make install

Although I would suggest using a program such as checkinstall to wrap the 
installation in a platform specific package, if possible.

This package will install the plugins into /usr/lib/lv2 by default.

To install to another directory, use the option --with-lv2-dir=DIR
